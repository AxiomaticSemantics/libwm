Introduction
============

libmwm is an *INTERNAL* library which contains functions that mwm and related
tools (mwm-msg, mwm-input, mwm-nagbar, mwm-config-wizard, mwm-bar) use.

It is not intended to be used by other programs.

Structure
=========

Every function gets its own .c file, which in turn gets compiled into an .o
object file. Afterwards, all .o files are archived into one static library
(libmwm.a). This library will be linked into all mwm binaries. The linker is able
to eliminate unused .o files when linking, so only the functions which you
actually use will be included in the corresponding binary.
